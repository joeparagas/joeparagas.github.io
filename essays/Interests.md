	y main interest in software engineering is to learn and develop a sports application, in which the public is free to use. Sports is a hobby of mine that I enjoy watching, and I am always thinking of ways to make the viewer experience better. In the recent years, analytics have become a trend in the sporting world. One thing that is cool about sports is how people tend to debate who is the better player and the problem is some of the arguments you hear are completely ridiculous. For example, some people argue that if a player has more championships than the other player, they are therefore the better player. What I plan to do is use analytics to help promote sports to the general public. I feel that with new advancements in statistics, sports can evolve from a player/team perspective as well as the fan perspective.
	
	As far as experience, I’d like to experience being a developer and writing actual code for a company. I would like to apply techniques learned in my classes to a real world job that affects the general public. As that is the main goal, I realize that there are steps that I need to take to get there. The first step is for me to go and intern at a company. I feel that if I surround myself with the right people I feel they can help me achieve my goals. Preferably, I’d like to work somewhere where my job would involve data management. With my knowledge and experience of using Java, C/C++, and now Javascript, there are a bunch of doors that can be opened. 
	
	I would like to continue to sharpen my skills with programming languages that I have been learning. I’d also like to learn Python, since it is good for data analysis, which is something that I would like to look into. Another skill that I’d like to have is the ability to teach languages to people. In order to do that I’m going to have to master the languages.
