Experiencing Semantic UI, I thought it was very challenging at first. The first couple of practice WODs were really tough. Seeing the code not being executed got really frustrating at times. For me it took a while to get used to, because I really had no experience with HTML/CSS. I found the idea of using “containers” to be very confusing at first. One of the problems I had was trying to put icons and text in the right positions. The reason was because I was unfamilliar with creating classes in the style sheet. The problem was that I would get confused because I was mixing classes and didn’t know how to fix the borders or align the text so that it would appear in a column. I really had to practice to get comfortable with that aspect of HTML.The more time I invested into figuring out Semantic UI, the easier it became. I realized that it was much simpler than it seemed at first. The one thing I noticed is that you have a bunch of classes that you can use to create an awesome webpage. 
	
From working with Semantic UI for the first time I would say that it has benefits over other frameworks. It’s no so much figuring out how to write code but rather how to use the framework. If you want to go right into developent I think Semantic UI is the way to go as it is really time-efficient. The downside to Semantic UI is that it may be difficult if you're not familiar with coding. If you’re really familiar with how HTML/CSS works you can create a website in real quick. Also the themes of the websites you create are pretty cool as well. The key is really to just gain more experience because honestly it is pretty simple to use.
