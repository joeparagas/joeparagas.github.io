Problem: Students tend to struggle by using conventional study techniques, such as doing reviews, study guides, etc.

Solution: By turning studying into a multiplayer game similar to that of games like Karuta for learning Japanese hiragana and katakana, it would help students learn the material more easily.

Ideas: Students are able to make cards with study material based on the class their enrolled in. Instructors have the ability to correct these cards and add/delete material they deem relevant to the course. Questions are answered in a round-robin style, where every correct answer the student would gain a point 

Case 1: Cards Against Humanity Style 
    Each card has a question and the students have a time limit to answer these questions. If the question is not answered, no student receives points and a new question will be displayed. 
    
Case 2: Karuta 
    A question is asked and you have to choose the correct answer among the set of possible answers.
