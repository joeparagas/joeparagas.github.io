Tarogotchi is a project we were assigned to develop a plant simulator. This project was designed to help me practice translating an algorithm into programming code.The simulator will be interactive where the userneeds to click (using the mouse) on either the water-can or the manure barrow to water or fertilize the taro plant to help it to grow. The amount of water and manure in the soil is indicated by the size of the water drop and the manure pile. As the plant grows the stem of the plant gets thicker and longer, while the leaf itself grows in size. The health of the plant is determined by the color of the stem. A brownish stem indicates a sick plant. A green stem indicates a healthy plant.
