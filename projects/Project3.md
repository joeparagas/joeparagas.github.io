For this final project I had to work with a group to develop a game. What we decided to do was a car racing game. The idea behind our game was for the user to try to stay alive without crashing into the other cars. The longer you were able to survive, the more points you got. 

The roles for this project were distributed like this: 

1. I was in charge of creating the car racer class. This involved movement of the car (forward, left, right, but not backwards). 

2. Another group member was in charge of creating the class that would create the road

3. The final group member was in charge of creating the class that sent out the other cars that the main racer had to avoid.
