This project gave me practice with the concepts of file reading, object oriented programming, and arrays.

The simulator had to follow these conditions: 
1. Load a map of the house comprised of wall and dirt pieces.
2. It will create a Roombrah that will move diagonally around the room.
3. Whenever the Roombrah touches a wall it will bounce off the wall.
4. Whenever the Roombrah touches a piece of dirt it removes the dirt.

The project was split into two parts. 
For the first part of the project we had to design a map, and we were given an algorithm to turn into code. The program had to read the file and examine each character. If the character was labeled a "W" that stood for a wall, and "D" stood for dirt. Here is an example of the map:

For the second part of the project we I had to use my knowledge of Object Oriented Programming. I created a Roombrah class, which controlled the movement of the roombrah. Whenever the roombrah would hit a wall, it would have to bounce of the wall and head in another direction. If the roombrah came across dirt it had to clean it up.
