This project our group decided to make a car game. The idea is that the user would control a car and if it crashed into the wall or another car, the game would end. The object of the game was to stay alive as long as possible without crashing. The longer you stayed alive, the more points you gain.

The work load for this project was split amongst 3 group members. One member worked on the car class. One group member worked on the other car class. The final group member worked on the road class.
